{"name":"Intelli#","tagline":"Plugins for C# & .NET development in IntelliJ IDEA","body":"# IntelliSharp\r\nIntelliSharp is a bundle of plugins for [IntelliJ IDEA (Community + Ultimate Edition)](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community), which together enable C# & .NET development inside IntelliJ IDEA.\r\n\r\n# Origins\r\nThis project is a backport of the [Consulo IDE](https://github.com/consulo/consulo) ‒ a fork of [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community) with support for C# and .NET development ‒ to the main IntelliJ IDEA platform.\r\n\r\nAll credit for the features taken from Consulo goes to its original author(s); see the commit history for more information on who contributed which feature.\r\nThe sources from Consulo are used under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\r\n\r\n## Why not just use Consulo?\r\nThe short answer is: To have unlimited access to the rich set of other plugins that are available for the IntelliJ IDEA platform.\r\nAlthough the [github.com/consulo](https://github.com/consulo) contains forks of many common IntelliJ Plugins, these are necessarily out-of-date with respect to their upstream counterparts.\r\n\r\nAlso, by preventing the use of the Consulo plugins in the official IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, the size of the user base ‒ and thus the number of possible contributors ‒ is unnecessarily limited.\r\nThe aim of IntelliSharp project is to make the plugins available to a wider audience.\r\n\r\n# Contributing\r\nContributions are welcome!\r\nSee the main [Intelli# Home](https://github.com/intellisharp/intellisharp-home) repository on GitHub for more information.\r\n\r\nThis website is itself open-sourced and available at [github.com/intellisharp/intellisharp.github.io](https://github.com/intellisharp/intellisharp.github.io).\r\n\r\n# License\r\nSource code, documentation and website are licensed under the [**Apache License, Version 2.0**](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
